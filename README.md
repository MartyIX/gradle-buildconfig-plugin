# Gradle BuildConfig plugin for Java projects
Provides one or multiple classes (per source set) generated and compiled by
the build script (`build.gradle`) containing constants (`static final`) with
info from the build, like version (`BuildConfig.VERSION`) or name
(`BuildConfig.NAME`) or any other information.

# Requirement

The `java` plugin needs to be applied prior to this plugin.

# Download

Build script snippet for use in all Gradle versions:

```gradle
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.de.fuerstenau:BuildConfigPlugin:1.0"
  }
}

apply plugin: "de.fuerstenau.buildconfig"
```

Build script snippet for new, incubating, plugin mechanism introduced in Gradle 2.1:

```gradle
plugins {
  id "de.fuerstenau.buildconfig" version "1.0"
}
```

# Usage

## Basics

By default the plugin does _nothing_. Yes, that is right. Because of the
different combinations of source sets (introduced by `java`-plugin) a project
can hold, there would be the potential to mess things up by having a default
_build config_ included by simply applying the plugin.

`Build configs` are configured using the `buildConfig` closure, containing a
`sourceSets` closure and then for every source set an own configuration closure.
The simplest closure would look like this:

```gradle
buildConfig {
  sourceSets {
    main {
    }
  }
}
```

`main` is the default source set introduced by the `java` plugin for gradle.
If no further configuration is made, the _build config_ uses the defaults (see
[Defaults](/Defaults/)).

At the moment there are these properties to configure:

* `packageName`,
* `appName`,
* `version`.

The following closure would configure the _build config_ for the `main` source
set to use _Supercool App_ as name, and using the project version (set to `1.0`
earlier) in combination with a custom suffix. Also the package for the
_build config_ class is changed to `de.fuerstenau.somepackage`.

```gradle
group = 'org.acme'
version = '1.0'

buildConfig {
  sourceSets {
    main {
      packageName = 'de.fuerstenau.somepackage'
      appName = 'Supercool App'
      version = version + '-ALPHA'
    }
  }
}
```

The result would be a class

```java
package de.fuerstenau.somepackage;

public final class BuildConfig
{
  public static final String VERSION = "1.0-ALPHA";
  public static final String NAME = "Supercool App";
}
```

which then could be referenced in the app like this

```java
import de.fuerstenau.somepackage.BuildConfig;

public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main (String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println (BuildConfig.NAME);
      System.out.println (BuildConfig.VERSION);
   }
}
```

## Custom fields

Custom fields can be added via `buildConfigField` method which takes the type,
the name and the value of the custom field as parameter. All parameters have to
be given as strings (and escaped if necessary, single `String` and `char`
values being the exception).

```gradle
buildConfigField "type", "name", "value"
```
For example, some custom fields:

```gradle
buildConfig {
  sourceSets {
    main {
      buildConfigField "boolean", "IS_DEBUG", "false"
      buildConfigField "String", "SECRET_WORD", "Hinterland"
      buildConfigField "char", "MYCHAR", "a"
    }
  }
}
```

Any types can be referenced, the plugin will not make any imports, therefore
fully qualifierd names have to be used.

*Any garbage entered will likely lead to uncompilable code*

## Manual Wiring

It is also possible to not use the _buildConfig_ configuration closure and
create and wire the tasks manually. The plugin does this automatically for
every source set after evaluating the configuration closure.

It creates a `de.fuerstenau.gradle.buildconfig.GenerateBuildConfigTask` and
uses its outputs as inputs for a `JavaCompile` task and adds the outputs of the
latter as dependency for the `compile` configuration for the source set, and
also adds them to the source set outputs. That way the _build config_ is
included in the artifact _jar_.

Here is an example of manual wiring:

```gradle
task generateBuildConfig (type: de.fuerstenau.gradle.buildconfig.GenerateBuildConfigTask) {
    appName = "SuperTrooperStarshipApp"
    version = "1.1.2"
}

task compileBuildConfig(type:JavaCompile, dependsOn: generateBuildConfig) {
    classpath = files () // empty file collection
    destinationDir = new File("${buildDir}/generatedClasses/main")
    source = generateBuildConfig.outputDir
}

afterEvaluate {
    dependencies {
        compile compileBuildConfig.outputs.files
    }
    sourceSets.main.output.dir compileBuildConfig.outputs.files
}
```

# Defaults

The default values for a _build config_ source set configuration closure are

* `appName` defaults to the project name,
* `version` defaults to the project version,
* `packageName` defaults to the project group or `de.fuerstenau.buildconfig`
  if group was not defined.

A resulting `BuildConfig` class will have the constants `NAME` and `VERSION`
( both type `String`).
